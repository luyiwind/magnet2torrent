# Version: 0.1 (beta)						   #
# Purpose:							   #
# I wrote/tested this in about an hour to enhance the functionality#
# of Sonarr/Radarr's torrent black hole feature to convert .magnet #
# files (links) into a torrent file that rtorrent could natively   #
# import through my specified watch folder while preserving my     #
# custom labels, download directories, etc.			   #
# If you found this script then you must already know my pain lol  #
#								   #
# Function:							   # 
# This loops through all the .magnet files in the directory saved  #
# in $FILES and passes them through to ih2torrent which is itself  #
# running in a python virtualenv (to prevent conflicts) that takes #
# the infohash or magnet url and turns it into a .torrent file that#
# rtorrent can then import through its watch folder.               #
#								   #
# All credit for ih2torrent goes to 				   #
# Elektito: https://github.com/elektito/ih2torrent                 #
# I look forward to seeing your v1.0 release with support for      #
# magnets with trackers!                                           #

# First some general file cleanup for my sanity.                   #
# this just deletes any torrent files older than 2 days            #
# which should gave rtorrent plenty of time to have picked them up.#
